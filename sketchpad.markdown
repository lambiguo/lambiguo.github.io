I'll use this to write random ideas that I'll probably want to talk about.

EMH variations
- Classical one
- In pharmacology
- CICO
- Social Engineering
- Stock market comic from smbc
- neural structure
This is really just a way of having a status quo bias!


I can't talk to people in real time. I can't get close to people.

I don't direct conversation to interesting stuff.

I had a strong bias to not change subject, while it's a great thing to do in conversation. People don't even notice.
