Today, in a spiral of unfocused scrolling, I stumbled upon [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHbzyxnqMjg](this).

The story is typical. Random person goes through his life while not being particularly virtuous. Then, the *event* happens and everything changes. [https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/542554-taking-lsd-was-a-profound-experience-one-of-the-most](He takes LSD), [https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/about/newtonsappletree/](an apple falls on his head), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_on_the_Way_to_Damascus](God makes him fall from an horse) or [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-aha-moment-that-changed-his-life.html](he just realizes that he's not the smartest).

In the first link, a father goes to the doctor and the doctor tells him that with its current health habits, he'll probably not live long enough to see his own daughter graduating from high school.

As all good stories, the good guys win. The father gets back on track, loses weight, starts becoming successful and lives happily ever after.

*Why can't this happen to me?*

I've had the revelations.

- Life is short. I'm wasting my best years doing nothing at all, not even having much fun!
- I won't remember all the time spent on Facebook if not as one giant regret.
- I should be bolder. If I tried some weird new thing everyday I'd find dozens of really cool things that would improve and enrich my life.
- The most important and interesting thing in the world is people. Make connections with them.
- There are some credible threats to humanity's continued existence that will become crucial in your lifetime. Help fight against them.

... but they don't seem to work.

I sometimes wish that something very tragic happened to me so that I would finally get on track, understand what is the meaning of my life and be better. Or, at least, just let me be motivated in one direction for a long time. That would be enough.

But then I think that this is not the way that humans work. All the success stories are a giant case of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias](survivorship bias) and [https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/narrative-fallacy](narrative fallacy).

1000 obese people get told that their weight will be a huge problem to their health. 5 manage to change their behavior. Those 5 talk about it and state the talk with the doctor as a life changing event.

1000 people get rich/famous/successful. All 1000 of them see their lives through the lenses of narrative and find some key moments that changed everything.

I realize that there are things such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder](PTSD). This in a way proves that it's possible to change people forever with a single event. But this is mostly a physical and subconscious phenomenon. As far as I'm aware you can't get PTSD from a calm conversation about terrible things. Can an idea change from a simple conversation really change my behavior?

Well it must be possible!. There is such a thing as psychotherapy, and despite my [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis](favorite topic of discussion), it's clearly valuable and important and effective. [http://www.ny-psychotherapy.com/effective-psychotherapy/]("Studies indicate that 75% of the patients undergoing psychotherapy show a positive signs of improvement").

So what to make of this? There must be a way to change behavior to "get better". But realization from me thinking about life do not seem to work, and I don't really believe any big single cause theory in other people's lives.

Once I will be better, I'll come back here and commit the [https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/narrative-fallacy](narrative fallacy) myself to describe how I did it.
