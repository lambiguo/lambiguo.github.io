Just as I was saying yesterday before getting carried away, "Out of all the people I know, I'm the one that is least capable of introspection".

I am thinking of trying to "solve" this "issue".

The main problem for me in looking for a "cure" is that I'm not sure if I believe in introspection.

I believe that it's very easy to fool myself. The most likely outcome of me trying to introspect is getting revelations that feel good but ultimately are meaningless. In fact, I have no memory of figuring something out about me changing anything in my real world behavior. Of course this is probably the result of me being bad at introspection, but it makes it difficult to try and thing about what to do.

I once took acid alone. I had this long day of thinking about random topics, it was great! At some point, I had the biggest revelation about how I could become more motivated and overcome the slump that I was in that period.

Most stories like this end up with the tripper not remembering anything afterwards. But, I do remember. And the ideas was an unremarkable one. It ringed right, was something that I had not tried and was admittedly quite basic and mundane. But still, it had 0 effect on the real me. I can't really believe in introspection because deep down I believe that it would have the same result as the acid trip idea.

I am not even sure that there is such a thing as a legible internal state. The more I learn and think about the world, the more I think of people as a jumbling mess of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network](CNN) or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)](Transformers) or [https://deepmind.com/blog/article/generally-capable-agents-emerge-from-open-ended-play](whatever Deepmind agents are using). And one of the properties of these systems is that they are difficult to understand. Once the network has been trained, it's very hard to guess why it's choosing a given answer. Brilliant people are working on this to try and make it better (due to the strong implications on [https://intelligence.org/why-ai-safety/](AI safety)).

... and I don't really believe there will ever be a solution (I'm also pessimistic about the AI alignment problem, but that's a whole other discussion).

So, just like it's practically impossible to "see" why [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3](GPT-3) is choosing to continue a sentence with a given word, it might be impossible to really get at the inner working of our minds. Most importantly, even if we can get in some low level sense what is happening (neuron x is firing due to connections abc and input k), there is no high level order or structure present. Or if there is, it looks like [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Visualization-of-the-conv1-filters-for-ResNet-101-The-image-on-the-left-represents-the_fig10_326646604](ResNet convolutional layers visualizations). It is reasonable how some of those masks could be used to detect edges of various shapes, but to form a theory and understanding on how they work is impossible.

Still, what if I ignore my model of the world and try anyway due to the possible high upside and the countless reports of people successfully doing it?

I'd try a few things.

First, I'd probably try some easy to learn and apply self-therapy methodologies that have good track records of evidence and results. I am mostly interested in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model](Internal Family System models) and [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GLPaZamxqkx7XJbXv/the-skill-of-noticing-emotions](noticing).

They are both techniques that have existed for a long time and can be relatively easily applied by a single person on themselves. They both can be learned by simply reading a book (they also both feature in the excellent [http://daystareld.com/pokemon/](Pokemon the Horigin of species)).

These would probably work better if performed by a trusted professional. A professional then can help using on the myriads of different ideas and techniques that have been developed in psychotherapy in the last century. The main obstacle for me in doing that is the price tag. I'm still a student, and I have no real strong psychological issues. I can't justify the money investment. Also, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis](replication crisis) is one of my favorite topics. I don't have strong trust anymore on psychology techniques. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict](Dodo bird effect) is also not helping.

Something else that a lot of people swear by is trying self therapy aided by psychedelics. I have not actually tried that despite my earlier anecdote (it was just a short burst of thinking). Trying a full trip to focus on introspection is something that I will try for sure before or later.
