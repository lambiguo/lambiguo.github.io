Out of all the people I know, I'm the one that is least capable of introspection. I don't really have a reason or narrative for anything I do at all. When sometimes I feel "weird", "unmotivated" or "happy" I have no idea why that is.

This is not only a psychological phenomenon. In the most basic sense, I lack a model of how me and my body really work. I also have trouble determining why my energy levels are low/high on a given day (Too little sleep? Too many carbs? Not enough sunlight? Too hot and humid? Drank too little?).

I feel like a very important low hanging fruit for me to work on would be to get a simple basic model of all these things. Starting from the physical should be relatively easy.

... except that it's not. I am way too interested in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases](cognitive biases) and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis](replication crisis) to believe that I'd be able to build even a simple model of myself. Misguiding myself without meaning too is the most probable result of any such attempt.

But still, isn't it crazy that I have no idea about how to optimize lots of seemingly easy stuff?

It drives me nuts to think that there are 5 million diet books sold in the US every year, and all of them give different and contrasting recommendations. How the hell are we not figuring this out?

I understand that the problem is not at all easy. The body is way too complex and variable. Different people from different geographic areas may require different diets to work optimally. Even close relatives may be different in key ways. The body is so complex that it evades all attempts at physical modeling, so we have to rely on messy statistical data on interventions that only have a plausible mechanism of action.

But, are we really beaten that easily?

Building a nuclear power plant is very hard.
- You need to have some genius somewhere build the theoretical foundation on how out universe really works.
- You need the scientific community to eventually accept the ideas and teach them.
- You need to figure out how to apply them to real world problems.
- You need to invest an incredible amount of money in building prototypes trying to ensure that all of them work correctly and are safe-ish.
- You need to finally convene on a design for the power plant that is bigger than any single mind can understand. And this needs to be done in an incredibly big organizations with all [https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/](Molochian) problems that follow.
- You need to bring together thousands (millions? Billions?) of different parts manufactured in different places. Assemble all of them together hoping that no giant mistakes were made anywhere
- You need competent government infrastructure and workforce to correctly operate the facility.

AND WE DID IT!

So, the basic question is, why aren't we doing the same in terms of understanding the human body?

Don't get me wrong, we are doing a ton of work on the human body. But that is mostly in terms of healing it from dangerous effects. All drugs that we experiment on are attempts at solving some problems. Barely any work is focused on nootropics to enhance normal people.

Why?

One possible explanation is that it's economically unfeasible. But the issue is: it's not true. Even increasing the world's population productivity by as little as 2% would have massive effects.

Then, [https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/](Moloch) come back. The real issue is that knowledge of effective ways of maximizing productivity in the human body is a
