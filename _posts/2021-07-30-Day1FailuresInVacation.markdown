I've recently come back from a vacation in which I was the organizer. It has been partly terrible.

I'm not very good at organizing groups of people. I've routinely underestimated the variance in preferences and expectations of the group. This has also been exacerbated by the fact that I did not know very well (or at all) 3 of the 8 guests. Hence I came out as stressed, frustrated and bossy.

In the end things were not too bad, we had fun without too many hiccups.

This has made me think (for the millionth time) some about Moloch and coordination problems. The vacation should have been the perfect easy moment to get a good amount of cooperation in it. We were 8 people working together with the goal of having fun. We all put a premium on other people having fun with us and sticking together. But still, making everybody happy was very hard.

Even with only 8 people, managing a discussion to decide what to do next was next to impossible. Sustaining the attention to everybody on any issue and getting to a satisfactory answer was only achieved once in the whole vacation. If I were able to handle being the "boss" or "leader" more, then I could probably have made it work. But that does not suit me too much.

What I tried instead was being a benevolent dictator that leaves people some time to themselves. I decided most activities after brief conversations to isolated people to guess what they wanted to do. This felt natural as I was the "domain expert" (it was my house, I was the only person to have been there several times, I knew the good beaches, spots).

But me deciding everything came out as too bossy. And I was admittedly very bad at understanding what people want out of a vacation. I have admittedly been on very few vacations with people that were not family or significant others, so I had very little exposure to what other people want.

To me, in a vacation you walk around a lot and are very active trying to see as many things as humanly possible in the allotted time. It is not uncommon for me to walk 15+ km in a day of vacation in a big city to try and see everything. You eat whatever picks your interest as you are wandering. You buy very little stuff.

Writing this I realize how narrow and stupid my experience has been. People in this last vacation where visibly tired of walking around all the time (we walked much lass than the 15km I did in other places, I'm not a madman). They would have rather have rested in the same place. Also, they cared much less than me about seeing the city: they wanted to be more in the beach. Some wanted to slowly go around in the shopping places to buy merchandise and postcards.

... and I was far too slow to adapt to these things.

One thing I still have no idea how I could have done better was managing alone and split time. A few times we were in a small city and I just let everyone roam around freely, but people still wanted to stick together and come behind me.

We once were in the middle of the main plaza of a very touristy location at lunch time. I told everybody that I had no idea how to recommend a place to eat there, so we could just split up and go roaming. I was trying to do this as I knew that different people had already asked me to eat very different things (street food vs restaurant vs vegan vs fish vs pizza) and no single place could accomodate everybody.

The correct play was probably to still split up after a small period of roaming together to look at a few possible alternatives.

I will probably be thinking (and writing) more about the vacation in the near future.
