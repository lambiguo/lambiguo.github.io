It has occurred to me that I'm terrible at being recommended things. The vast majority of my media diet is the result of me exploring by myself. I almost never listen to people telling me how great and interesting a book/movie/course/album is.

I have no idea how normal this is. It seems to me that I get a ton of second-hand recommendations (people recommending media that they learned through recommendation). Which would mean that somebody somewhere is actually good at following advice.

But I just can't get myself to do it. Most of the time, if I am consuming media that I've heard from somebody, I am doing it a ton later after having rediscovered it myself.

Some of this is explainable due to differences in taste. I have been reading a ton of [https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index/](rational fiction) lately. I am in general following the [https://www.lesswrong.com/](rationalist community) very closely. I love music from the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F2sK2aO8-U](Diverse systems) label. I listen to a lot of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3frA_rj918](dream pop) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-0TYeg9Rzc](chillwave). I am not much of a movie person.

None of my real life friends have read any rational fiction. The few ones that know about the rationalist community don't really care (and have been introduced by me). Nobody likes Diverse systems. Very few like dream pop and chillwave. This makes me feel kind of alienated sometimes.

But the difference in taste is not enough of an explanation. I enjoy popular Netflix shows, League of Legends and pop music as much as anybody. Hell, a few weeks ago I was recommended a manga with a strong power fantasy theme (I love power fantasy themes!) and I did not even start reading the first chapter.

My father loves being the hipster. He'll routinely introduce me to new music and brag about how unknown it is. He's the kind of person that likes a song more if it has less than 50k view on Youtube. Maybe I just hereditated some of that by osmosis (or genetics).

Maybe I prefer looking for stuff myself. I really like the serendipitous steps of discovering new stuff. Getting a recommendation kind of feels like cheating.

Maybe consuming media after advice has added cost. When somebody has me watch a movie they like, I feel some kind of additional pressure. There's the pressure of having to really pay attention so that you have something to say and discuss, and a lesser pressure on liking it. I prefer to be relaxed when consuming media.

Or maybe I'm just too stubborn and proud, and making others choose what I read is too much. A constant in my life right now is that I'd love to have more agency in all things (still a student living with my parents off their money...). Choosing my own media without listening to anybody is a form of agency (talk about [https://lambiguo.github.io/2021/08/02/Day4Introspection.html](overfitting introspection)).

One thing that I'm curios about is how common this is. It's in moments like this that I wish I has 10k Twitter followers to make a poll and find out.

I'd also love for more people to have public diaries such as this one. I love browsing the old [https://guzey.com/personal/my-journal/](alexey guzey) one or the [http://visakanv.com/1000/](1000 words vomits) from [https://twitter.com/visakanv](visakanv). Internal experience of people is insanely varied (or at least it looks like it is), learning more about it would be very interesting.
